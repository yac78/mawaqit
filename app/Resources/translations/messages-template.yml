      The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said
      "Whoever does the ablutions perfectly then goes to jumu`a and then listens and is silent,
      he is forgiven what is between that time and the following Friday and three more days
      and the one who touches stones has certainly made a futility"
