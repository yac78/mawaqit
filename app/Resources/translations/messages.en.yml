        Today, most of our mosques are equipped with old digital clocks like an electronic board.
        Unfortunately these clocks do not respond to the increasingly varied and demanding needs of our mosques
        Digital clocks are usually configured every day or automatically with sometimes inaccurate schedules
        and not necessarily suited to the city in which the mosque is located.
        In addition, their functionality is limited to the display of prayer times.
        With the help of Allah the all mighty, we have developed a software to improve and simplify the presentation of prayer times. <br>
        Our solution is a WAQF fi sabili Allah and therefore free. The code is open source, it is
        accessible on github at the following link
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ibrahim-zehhaf/mawaqit">https://github.com/ibrahim-zehhaf/mawaqit</a> <br>
        <i style="font-weight:bold" class="fa fa-warning"></i> ANY USE FOR PURPOSE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED, PLEASE RESPECT OUR CHOICE.

    feature1: Display of prayer times in several languages. 2 choices of calculation, automatic or by annual calendar
    feature2: A visual and sound signal to announce the adhan and the iqama
    feature3: |
      Between the adhan and the iqama, and after each prayer, reminders and invocations are displayed.
      A Prophet's Hadith "May Allah's Prayer and Salvation Be to Him" is also displayed every 5 min
    feature4: |
      Communicate with the faithful of your mosque through announcements and flash messages,
      at the mosque and everywhere else on the mobile app
    feature5: Multiple choices of colors, themes and wallpapers
    feature6: City weather display
    feature7: Multiple options, such as turning off the screen during prayer and the jumu`a sermon
    feature8: Control the screen from your computer, smartphone or tablet 24/7
    feature9: A mobile application on iPhone and Android (Find a nearby mosque, route, prayer notification, useful info... etc.)

      <p>
        Well done ! you installed the system image on the memory card of your raspberry, you now have two options:<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
          <strong>OPTION 1 (Recommanded): </strong> Use the connected version, it has the following advantages
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Remote control from your smartphone or any computer and tablet</li>
          <li>A synchronized version on all the terminals, mobiles, tablets and screens of the mosque</li>
          <li>Send messages and announcements on the screen from your smartphone or computer</li>
          <li>You benefit from the latest updates automatically without any manipulation</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-left: 2rem">
          <strong>Follow the steps below : </strong>
      </p>
    install7: |
      <ol>
        <li>Start the raspberry and connect a usb keyboard and mouse</li>
        <li>Connect it to the internet (WIFI or Ethernet cable)</li>
        <li>
            Open the file <code>online_site.txt</code> present on the desktop and replace its content with the link
            generated in your account, example: <br>
            <code>mosqueUrl<br></code>
        </li>
        <li>Save and exit</li>
        <li>Launch Mawaqit from the desktop</li>
        <li>
          At launch, the raspberry check if an internet connection is available,
          in this case it launches the online version, otherwise it switches to the offline version
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p><strong>OPTION 2: </strong>
          Use the offline version, just plug the raspberry on the screen, the software will launch itself.<br>
          <strong>Important :</strong>
          The Raspberry does not have an RTC clock (an electronic component with a battery) which allows
          keeping the time correctly set when it is off.<br>
          So it is advisable to equip the raspberry
          <a href="rtc_link">
              with RTC
          </a>
          if you do not plane to connect it to the internet, this will avoid
          loss of system time in the event of a power failure.
          Just plug it in as illustrated below and type the following command in LXTerminal<br>
          <code>sudo date -s "%now%" && sudo hwclock -w</code> <br><br>
      </p>

jumuaReminder:
  text: |
    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said
    "Whoever does the ablutions perfectly then goes to jumu`a and then listens and is silent,
    he is forgiven what is between that time and the following Friday and three more days
    and the one who touches stones has certainly made a futility"

duaAfterAthan:
  title: Invocation after adhân
  text: |
    O Allah, Master of this perfect call and the prayer that we are going to perform, gives Muhammad the power to intercede
    (the Day of Judgment) and the place of honor [in Paradise], and resurrect him in the laudable position that You promised him

duaBetweenAthanAndIqama:
  text: "According to Anas Ibn Mâlik, the Prophet (sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: The invocations between Adhân and Iqâmah are not rejected"
